# Buying Themes

### Themeforest

You can always just buy a theme from [ThemeForest][themeforest]. 
For about $12-$15 dollars you can get a license to use someone's premade theme.
They are typically pretty solid, you just need to fill in your data into the the right divs.
Dealing with the bugs in a theme written by someone else can be a real pain. So it still pays off to 
know a little CSS before you buy a theme and try to get it working.

### Bootstrap Themes

These are generally free-$10 skins for Bootstrap. They replace the bootstrap.css 
file and give Bootstrap a more unique appearance by restyling all the basic elements.

The nice thing is that you can still use them just like bootstrap. 
So you could always start out with _vanilla_ bootstrap and add a theme later.
[WrapBootstrap][wrap-bootstrap] is an ugly cluttered website with a list of themes.
