##  Eye on the Prize: Gearing Up for Your Job Search

In just two short weeks, you'll be exiting the App Academy coding curriculum and entering the exciting world of applying for jobs as a software developer.  It's important to keep this in mind while you build your full-stack so that you set yourself up for success in the job search.

###  The Importance of Your Full-Stack Project

When it comes time to write your post-a/A resume, your full-stack project will be at the very top.  It's the best evidence that you will have of your competence as a software developer.  Many employers will look at your full-stack project and decide whether or not to interview you based on how impressed they are by your site.  Here are the most important goals to keep in mind when you're creating your project:

1.  **Make the frontend beautiful, polished and professional**.  Like it or not, employers (especially non-technical folks, like HR managers) will judge your site by its cover.  No one will get to hear about your amazing backend magic if they disregard you because of your ugly frontend.  If you don't have a good eye for design, that's ok!  Use the site you're cloning as a template and make minor changes (or no changes) so that your coding skills shine through and aren't dragged down by poor design choices.

2.  **Favor bug fixes over additional functionality**.  Chances are that any potential employer won't spend more than 1-2 minutes perusing your site.  When they do this, it's imperative that no bugs are apparent.  Test your site frequently towards the end of the full-stack project curriculum by browsing for about 90 seconds -- no bugs should appear.  Remember to test on different devices (iPad, mobile phones, laptops, desktops) and using different monitor sizes.  

3.  **Make the demo/guest login obvious and easy to use**.  Employers will go to the trouble of making an account and signing in.  The demo user is a fast track -- remember, these folks are looking at hundreds of applications a day.  Make it efficient for them to enjoy your site.

### Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!  (And Features)

Not only will your full-stack project be key to getting your foot in the door at potential companies, it'll also come up in interviews, a lot.  You must be prepared to talk about it in a fluent, technical way.  Here are some questions you might encounter:

1.  What was the toughest bug you've ever encountered, and how did you fix it?

2.  Discuss a feature of your site that you're proud of.  

3.  What did you like about React/Rails/Technology X that you used?  What did you dislike?

4.  Describe how your site is designed.  What advantages/disadvantages does your design pattern have?  

5.  If you had to do this project over again, what would you do differently?  What was the biggest implementation or design mistake you made?

It's really hard to remember the details of bug fixes and feature implementations in retrospect, so we **highly** recommend that you document these things as you go.  Use your daily Tumblr post as a debrief, describing what the issue/feature/bug/behavior was, the steps you took to implement/fix it, and what the resulting, better behavior was.  Be as detailed as possible -- you'll thank yourself later!

### Other Considerations

As with the coding curriculum, the job search curriculum is a very busy time, and there's a lot to do.  The more you can get done in advance, the better.  Here are a few things to keep in mind as job search approaches:

1.  **Clothes**.  You don't need extremely formal clothes for interviews at tech companies, but you should have nice pants (khakis, nice jeans, etc.) or a business casual skirt and a nice shirt such as a button down.  Dressy shoes are fine, but so are Converses or similar "trendy" casual shoes.  Your clothes should fit you well and this may mean getting them tailored, which can take a few days.  Plan ahead.
2.  **Hair and hygiene.**  Get a nice-looking haircut sometime before or during job search curriculum.  If you have facial hair, make sure it is well-kempt.  And, of course, shower and wear clean clothes on interview days.
3.  **Laptop.**  Many companies will ask you to bring your own laptop to technical interviews, and you'll be using your own machine every day starting during job search curriculum.  Make sure yours is in working order and has all the necessary software setup.
4.  **Drugs.**  It's rare, but some tech companies do require drug tests for new employees.  Even though it's legal in California, marijuana can occasionally be a deal-breaker, especially for companies that are owned by large, out-of-state parent companies.  Weed can take 1-4 weeks to leave your system, so if this is a habit of yours, consider stopping well in advance of the interview process.  
5.  **Transportation**.  You may have interviews that are in far-flung parts of the Bay Area.  Some of these places are not very accessible by public transit.  If you don't own a car, make a plan -- look into [Getaround](https://www.getaround.com/), [Zipcar](http://www.zipcar.com/webch?&gclid=CLm8q_ey8MoCFQMHaQodBfULOA), or another car rental service.
