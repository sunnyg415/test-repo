# Full Stack Project Checklist

## Layout and CSS
- [ ] NY: Make sure the layout is EXACTLY like the site you're cloning.
- [ ] SF: Make sure your layout is intiutive, user-friendly, and looks nice.
Absolutely no bugs or broken links.
- [ ] Every page, no matter how insignificant, must be styled.
- [ ] Use a classy font, no Arial or Times New Roman. [Google Fonts][google-fonts] are a good choice.
- [ ] Style :hover actions of input, buttons and links, to show you can
click on things. More visual feedback!
- [ ] Style your input, textarea and button tags (use the same font,
color, etc. as the rest of your app)
- [ ] Use a consistent design everywhere, even if minimal, rather than something fancy here and there.

## Hosting
- [ ] Use your own custom domain (no herokuapps.com subdomain)
- [ ] Your dyno should stay awake. This only costs $7 per month.

## Data
- [ ] Have well groomed seed data (real world stuff, no lorem ipsum)
- [ ] Have a guest account (or two, if you need both to demo)
- [ ] Use your seed data to welcome the Guest User to your site and introduce yourself (link to your Github, LinkedIn, etc)
- [ ] Have buttons to fill out complex forms for the Guest User (with nice seed data)
- [ ] Have a one to three sentences statement on your homepage describing
your app ("A Tumblr clone", "A Rap Genius clone to annotate dolphin
sounds" etc.)

## UX
- [ ] Actions like save, befriend, delete, etc. must be acknowleged by providing
visual feedback to the user.
- [ ] Add flash messages to acknowledge saves, etc.
- [ ] Add helpful tips here and there on the spot to guide the user through your app.
- [ ] Shouldn't have to say this, but use React (no Rails-only apps)
- [ ] Ask another student to walk through your app. See
where they struggle to understand features. Return this favor!

**Bonus**
Add a user notification model to show feedback and results of actions.
Think of Facebook notifications for new comments, friend requests,
etc. You probably need polymorphic associations.

## Documentation
- [ ] Write a killer README covering concept, features, technologies and a
bunch of future todos (even if it's unlikely you'll ever do it, it
shows that you have thought about better ways to implement features,
etc.)

Finally, if you want bonus points, take an hour and read the book ["Don't Make
Me Think"][krug-book] by Steve Krug. It's a fun and easy read, and most of all,
you'll be able to apply it right away to your app. Most likely you will win
points with interviewers for knowing or mentioning this book. It's a dearly
loved book, and one of Jonathan's all time favorites.

Double-bonus: [Make a logo][logo-generator] for your site.
