#Questions

We're coming to the end of our initial time with Rails, but we're still a long
way from mastery. Over the coming weeks, your learning about Rails will have to
be more self-guided. The instructors are always available to answer questions,
but we've already covered much of the instructional material.

To help you structure your learning going forward, and to help you uncover
the gaps in your knowledge of Rails, we give you this assignment:

### Generate 50 questions about Rails.

To generate questions, we advise that you do 4 things:

1. Visualize the lifecycle of a single request through
   a Rails application. Think about what data is passed
   around and how, and about what each piece of the
   application is doing.
2. Take a look at the project page and your own code for
   the [Newspaper project][newspaper-project] and think
   about how the various pieces of the application work.
   Focus especially on associations and nested forms.
3. Think about the exact flow of a nested form from
   hitting submit on the form all the way to creating the
   objects.
4. Review the topic list below.
