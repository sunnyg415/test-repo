# Simple CRUD app

The apps we've been building so far are called CRUD (create, read,
update, destroy) apps. Relatively straightforward rails apps like
these let us focus on core skills and (especially today), testing.

Today, pick a CRUD app to work on with your partner. Don't bite off
more than you can chew, but pick something you'll enjoy. The Secrets
and Band apps are good examples of what to aim for.

We'll have time to work on fancy projects later; today, focus on
something achievable in 8hrs that will give you practice with
testing. **Do the project TDD; you're supposed to learn how to test
today.**

Don't focus on rolling your own auth. You might want to do
unauthenticated login if the site should have user-specific
view. 

When you've decided, have us sign off on your project so we can reign
you in if you take on too much.
