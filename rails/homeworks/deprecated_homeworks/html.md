# HTML

Hypertext Markup Language is the language of web pages. The best, most complete HTML documentation is provided by the [Mozilla Developer Network][mdn-html]. This documentation is your friend.

You'll often hear HTML going along with CSS (cascading style sheets),
and while the two do often appear together, HTML is independent.  HTML
specifies structure and content. CSS specifies styling. We won't worry
about CSS for a little while.
