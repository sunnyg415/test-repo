## Topic 1: Nested Forms

0. When do we need to specify if a model `accepts_nested_attributes_for` a related model, vs setting `association_ids` as `attr_accessible` for a model?

0. Say we have a model 'coffee' that has many 'orders'. We want to create a new latte flavor while creating some orders at the counter. What associations/methods are missing from our coffee model for a nested form?

0. Implement the missing code below. Make sure to protect against empty records getting saved.

  ```ruby
  class Coffee < ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_accessible :name # something else here...

    has_many :orders
    # something else here...
  end
  ```

0. What purpose does the `build` method serve us in the below coffee controller? Implement a code example below for our nested form.

  ```ruby
  class CoffeesController < ApplicationController
    def new
      # what code do we need to supply our nested form with?
    end
  end
  ```

0. Let's write the form using `form_for` in our `new.html.erb` coffee view. Complete the missing sections to create a nested coffee/order form:

  ```html
  <%= form_for(@coffee) do |f| %>
    <!-- label for coffee :title -->
    <!-- input for coffee :title -->

    <!-- Nested form for :orders. What method is needed? -->
      <!-- collection to select users (each coffee has a user id) -->

    <%= f.submit %>
  <% end %>
  ```
