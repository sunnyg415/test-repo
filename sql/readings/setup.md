# Learning SQL Setup

## Installing Postgres

First, download and install [Postgres.app][postgres-app]. This is
already installed on the class Mac minis.

Follow the directions to add the
[command line tools][pg-command-line-tools] to your `$PATH` so that
you may use them in the terminal. This will involve adding
`PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin:$PATH"` to your
`~/.bashrc` file. For older versions of Postgres.app, you may have to
add `PATH="/Applications/Postgres93.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:$PATH"` or `"PATH=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:$PATH"`.

This will allow programs like Rails to access your Postgres database.

You will have to rerun `.bashrc` for the `$PATH` to be updated. The
easiest way to do this is to restart the terminal (alternatively run
`source ~/.bashrc` to force `$PATH` to be reloaded). If for some
reason putting it in `.bashrc` didn't help, put it in `.bash_profile`;
that should work.

**Linux users:** The [Ubuntu wiki][pg-linux] can help. See especially
"Alternative Server Setup".

## Creating the DB

Make sure Postgres.app is running (it's in your Applications). You
should see a little elephant icon in your top bar.

First, we need to create the database. Postgres can support multiple
applications, each of which might be storing different kinds of data
in their own **database**. Applications shouldn't have access to each
other's databases, even though they are all managed by a single
**database server** (Postgres is the database server).

Let's create a blank database named `bank`:

```
~$ psql
psql (9.2.2)
Type "help" for help.

ruggeri=# CREATE DATABASE bank;
CREATE DATABASE
ruggeri=# \q
```

We can connect to our bank DB. We run the `psql` program, giving it
the name of the DB we want to connect to.

```
~$ psql bank
psql (9.2.2)
Type "help" for help.

bank=# \d
No relations found.
```

### Importing the data

There's no data imported yet, so our db is a lonely place (`\d` is a
special Postgres command to list the tables). Let's run the import
script (which sets up the tables and adds the initial
records). Download my version of the
[LearningSQLExample.sql][learning-sql-example] script (or [legacy version][learning-sql-example-legacy] for the 1st Edition); I've modified
it to work with Postgres.

[learning-sql-example]: ../demos/learning_psql/learning-sql-example-postgres.sql
[learning-sql-example-legacy]: ../demos/learning_psql/learning-sql-example-postgres-1st-ed.sql

The `learning-sql-example-postgres.sql` file contains SQL commands. To
run them we need to "pipe them in" to `psql bank`. This is what the
shell's `|` operation does: `cat learning-sql-example-postgres.sql |
psql bank` takes the *output* of the first command (`cat
learning-sql-example-postgres.sql`, which just outputs the contents of
the file) and uses it as the *input* of the command on the right
(`psql bank`, which runs SQL commands).

There will probably be some notices about creating implicit sequences
and indexes; you may ignore these.

## Making your first query

Let's check on the data:

```
~$ psql bank
psql (9.2.2)
Type "help" for help.

bank=# \d
                  List of relations
 Schema |          Name          |   Type   |  Owner
--------+------------------------+----------+---------
 public | account                | table    | ruggeri
 public | account_account_id_seq | sequence | ruggeri
 public | branch                 | table    | ruggeri
 public | branch_branch_id_seq   | sequence | ruggeri
 public | business               | table    | ruggeri
 public | customer               | table    | ruggeri
 public | customer_cust_id_seq   | sequence | ruggeri
 public | department             | table    | ruggeri
 public | department_dept_id_seq | sequence | ruggeri
 public | employee               | table    | ruggeri
 public | employee_emp_id_seq    | sequence | ruggeri
 public | individual             | table    | ruggeri
 public | officer                | table    | ruggeri
 public | officer_officer_id_seq | sequence | ruggeri
 public | product                | table    | ruggeri
 public | product_type           | table    | ruggeri
 public | transaction            | table    | ruggeri
 public | transaction_txn_id_seq | sequence | ruggeri
(18 rows)

bank=# SELECT * FROM customer LIMIT 2;
 cust_id |   fed_id    | cust_type_cd |       address       |   city    | state | postal_code
---------+-------------+--------------+---------------------+-----------+-------+-------------
       1 | 111-11-1111 | I            | 47 Mockingbird Ln   | Lynnfield | MA    | 01940
       2 | 222-22-2222 | I            | 372 Clearwater Blvd | Woburn    | MA    | 01801
(2 rows)
```

Yay! You're good to go!

## Potential Pitfalls

### `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`

**First, check with a TA or instructor**.

In order to access postgres from your Rails application, you may need
to add this line:

    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Please do not add it unless (a) you have problems connecting from a
Rails app, (b) you made sure that running `psql` in the command line
**did work** (otherwise something else is the problem), and (c) your
TA gives you the okay.

This is usually a result of installing an old version of Postgres.app;
more recent versions shouldn't suffer this problem. You should first
try reinstalling Postgres.app.

### Shared Memory Problem

**First, check with a TA or instructor**.

There is another problem where postgres may fail to launch properly;
you won't be able to connect with `psql` (much less from Rails). To
diagnose the error, invoke postgres manually:

```
$ postgres -D ~/Library/Application\ Support/Postgres/var/ -p5432
7/7/12 8:24:23.017 PM com.heroku.postgres-service: server starting
7/7/12 8:24:23.018 PM Postgres: 75469 /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/pg_ctl: Status 0
7/7/12 8:24:23.117 PM com.heroku.postgres-service: FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument
7/7/12 8:24:23.117 PM com.heroku.postgres-service: DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5432001, size=14499840, 03600).
7/7/12 8:24:23.117 PM com.heroku.postgres-service: HINT:  This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment exceeded your kernel's SHMMAX parameter.  You can either reduce the request size or reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX.  To reduce the request size (currently 14499840 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's shared memory usage, perhaps by reducing shared_buffers or max_connections.
7/7/12 8:24:23.117 PM com.heroku.postgres-service: 	If the request size is already small, it's possible that it is less than your kernel's SHMMIN parameter, in which case raising the request size or reconfiguring SHMMIN is called for.
7/7/12 8:24:23.117 PM com.heroku.postgres-service: 	The PostgreSQL documentation contains more information about shared memory configuration.
```

If you have the SHM error messages, first, see if this solution fixes things:

```
sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=16777216
```

This is only a temporary fix; these settings will be lost when you
restart. For this reason, you want to edit the `/etc/sysctl.conf`
system file. Add these lines:

```
kern.sysv.shmall=65536
kern.sysv.shmmax=16777216
```

Now Postgres should work in the future.
