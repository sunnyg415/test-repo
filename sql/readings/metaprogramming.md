# Metaprogramming and Reflection

**Goals**:

* Learn how to use `send`.
* Learn how to use `define_method`.
* Learn how to use `method_missing`.

## `send` and `define_method`

One of the powers of Ruby is **reflection** (also called
**introspection**): the ability for a program to examine itself.

For starters, we can ask an object what methods it will respond to:

```
1.9.3p194 :001 > obj = Object.new
1.9.3p194 :002 > obj.methods
 => [:nil?, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :hash, :<=>, :class, ...]
```

`Object#methods` returns an array of symbols, each the name of a
method that can be sent to the object. This is helpful for debugging,
but not super useful in production code.

More significantly, we can call a method by name:

```
1.9.3p194 :003 > [].send(:count)
 => 0
```

When is something like send useful? Why not just call the method the
normal way? Well, using **`send`** lets us write methods like this:

```ruby
def do_three_times(object, method_name)
  3.times { object.send(method_name) }
end

class Dog
  def bark
    puts "Woof"
  end
end

dog = Dog.new
do_three_times(dog, :bark)
```

We can even define new methods dynamically with **`define_method`**:

```ruby
class Dog
  # defines a class method that will define more methods; this is
  # called a **macro**.

  def self.makes_sound(name)
    define_method(name) { puts "#{name}!" }
  end

  makes_sound(:woof)
  makes_sound(:bark)
  makes_sound(:grr)
end

dog = Dog.new
dog.woof
dog.bark
dog.grr
```

A couple notes:

* The code inside `Dog` class is executed at the time Ruby defines the
  `Dog` class. `makes_sound` is called at class definition time,
  **not** each time a new `Dog` object is created.
* That makes sense, because the work of `makes_sound` sets up an
  instance method to be shared by **all** `Dog` objects. It's not
  instance-specific.
* Inside the definition of the `Dog` class, `makes_sound` knows to
  call the class method because `self == Dog` here.
* In the `makes_sound` macro, `self == Dog` because this is a `Dog`
  class method. `define_method` is implicitly called on `Dog`, adding
  a new method named `name`. The block is the code to run when the
  method is (later) called on an instance of `Dog`.

We don't write macros every single day, but they are frequently quite
useful. Some of the most famous macro methods are:

* `attr_accessor`: defines getter/setter methods given an instance
  variable name.
* `belongs_to`/`has_many`: defines a method to perform a SQL query to
  fetch associated objects.

## `method_missing`

When a method is called on an object, Ruby first looks for an existing
method with that name. If no such method exists, then it calls the
`Object#method_missing` method. It passes the method name (as a
symbol) and any arguments to `#method_missing`.

The default version simply raises an exception about the missing
method, but you may override `#method_missing` for your own purposes:

```ruby
class T
  def method_missing(*args)
    p args
  end
end
```

```ruby
1.9.3p194 :007 > T.new.adfasdfa(:a, :b, :c)
[:adfasdfa, :a, :b, :c]
```

Here's a simple example:

```ruby
class Cat
  def say(anything)
    puts anything
  end

  def method_missing(method_name)
    method_name = method_name.to_s
    if method_name.start_with?("say_")
      text = method_name[("say_".length)..-1]

      say(text)
    else
      # do the usual thing when a method is missing (i.e., raise an
      # error)
      super
    end
  end
end

earl = Cat.new
earl.say_hello # puts "hello"
earl.say_goodbye # puts "goodbye"
```

Using `method_missing`, we are able to "define" an infinite number of
methods; we allow the user to call any method prefixed `say_` on a
`Cat`. This is very powerful; it isn't possible to do this using
`define_method` itself.

However, overriding `method_missing` can result in difficult to
understand/debug to code, and should not be your first resort when
attempting metaprogramming. Only if you want this infinite
expressability should you use `method_missing`; prefer a macro if the
user just wants to define a small set of methods.

`method_missing` is a cool trick, but I don't know that I've used it
in any of my professional projects. I do know that understanding it
helped me understand how Rails dynamic finders work.

### An advanced example: dynamic finders

Rails, for instance, has a way of finding objects through
`method_missing`:

```ruby
User.find_by_first_name_and_last_name("Ned", "Ruggeri")
User.find_by_username_and_state("ruggeri", "California")
```

Rather than create a method for every single possible way to search
(which is almost infinite), Rails overrides the `#method_missing`
method, and for `find_by_*` methods, it then parses the method name
and figures out how it should perform the search. Here's how it might
do this:

```ruby
class User
  def method_missing(method_name, *args)
    method_name = method_name.to_s
    if method_name.start_with?("find_by_")
      # attributes_string is, e.g., "first_name_and_last_name"
      attributes_string = method_name[("find_by_".length)..-1]

      # attribute_names is, e.g., ["first_name", "last_name"]
      attribute_names = attributes_string.split("_and_")

      unless attribute_names.length == args.length
        raise "unexpected # of arguments"
      end

      search_conditions = {}
      attribute_names.length.times do |i|
        search_conditions[attribute_names[i]] = args[i]
      end

      # Imagine search takes a hash of search conditions and finds
      # objects with the given properties.
      self.search(search_conditions)
    else
      # complain about the missing method
      super
    end
  end
end
```

## Type introspection

So far we focused on finding, defining, and calling methods at
runtime. We can also find class information:

```ruby
1.9.3p194 :021 > "who am i".class
=> String
1.9.3p194 :022 > "who am i".is_a?(String)
=> true
```

I commonly use `Object#class` when debugging or using pry to see what
kind of thing I'm dealing with, so that I can then know what class to
look up the documentation for.

Here we can see that even classes are objects in Ruby:

```ruby
1.9.3p194 :038 > Object.is_a?(Object) # whoa: meta
=> true
```

Deep. Let's dig deeper:

```ruby
1.9.3p194 :008 > Object.class
=> Class
```

Okay, all classes are instances of a `Class` class.

```ruby
1.9.3p194 :009 > Class.superclass
=> Module
1.9.3p194 :010 > Class.superclass.superclass
=> Object
```

Classes are types of `Module`s (not important), which are
`Object`s. In Ruby everything is an `Object`, even `Class`es!

To summarize: `Object` is of type `Class`, which is a subclass of
`Object` itself. Whoa!

## Methods with varying argument type

Say we have written a method `perform_get` that fetches a resource
over the internet. As a convenience to the user, we'd like
`perform_get` to take either a `String`, which is the literal URL to
fetch, or a hash, with the URL broken into parts

```ruby
perform_get("http://www.google.com/+")
perform_get(
  :scheme => :http,
  :host => "www.google.com",
  :path => "/+"
)
```

In the case where we give `perform_get` a hash, it's going to need to
do some extra work to construct the URL to get. How might this work?
Perhaps like so:

```ruby
def perform_get(url)
  if url.is_a?(Hash)
    # url is actually a hash of url options, call another method
    # to turn it into a string representation.
    url = make_url(url)
  end

  # ...
end
```

This is a quite common trick used by library writers to make their
methods much more flexible. You may not write a method like this
often, but as you grow more experienced, this kind of trick will come
in handy from time to time.
