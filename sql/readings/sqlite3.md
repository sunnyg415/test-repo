# SQLite3

## What is SQLite3?

SQL is a language, but there are many different *implementations* of
SQL. An implementation of SQL is the software that actually processess
your SQL commands. A synonymous term is RDBMS (**relational database
management systems**): this is the software that stores the data, and
later figures out how to fetch it back when queried.

Each implementation is different; they all speak SQL, so there is a
mostly common interface to all the systems (each system has its own
quirks about SQL syntax). However, the various implementations also
can differ significantly under-the-hood. Each has its own specialties
and pitfalls.

Postgres (open source), Oracle, MySQL (open-source but now owned by
Oracle), and SQLServer (Microsoft) are some various RDBMS
implementations.

[SQLite3][sqlite-homepage] is another SQL implementation; it is a very
simple, public-domain implementation. Whereas most database *servers*
require a lot of setup and configuration, SQLite3 is *serverless*.
There is no separate server process that waits to receive queries from
your application. Instead, sqlite3 is a library loaded by your
program, which then directly interacts with the underlying database
data. This makes it easy to configure sqlite3 (there is no
configuration!) and to start using quickly.

Because there is no central SQLite3 server, it does not handle
multiple simultaneous query requests very well. For that reason,
SQLite3 is seldom used as a database for a production web
application. It also does not have a very sophisticated *query
planner* to figure out how to execute your query in the best way; this
can result in poor performance when working with larger sets of
data. However, the simplicity of setting up SQLite3 makes it very
common as a *development database* used while developers are building
an app, or as an *embedded* database distributed as part of another
program.

SQLite3 is the most widely deployed database of any. Every copy of
Firefox embeds a SQLite3 database (your user preferences are stored in
it). It is behind every iOS app.

## A Superquick Demo

First we write a SQL source file to generate our data. Check it out
[here][first-sql-demo]. **Read this demo and the comments!**

[first-sql-demo]: ../demos/sqlite3_demo/create_tables.sql

Then we can use SQLite3 to run the sql source, generating the tables.

    ~/sql-demo$ cat create_tables.sql | sqlite3 school.db

This tells sqlite3 to read/store data in `school.db`; since this doesn't
exist yet, sqlite3 will create it. The `|` (pipe) connects the output of the
command on the left (`cat create_tables.sql`) to the input of the command on
the right `sqlite3 school.db`). We say that `create_tables.sql` is "piped
into" the sqlite3 interpreter.

It is common to write such SQL scripts for either (a) scripts that configure
the setup of the database, like creating the tables or (b) "offline" scripts
that do not modify the database, but run a series of queries to generate a
report. For interactive SQL use (making queries and updates in response to
user interaction), we either use the SQLite3 client, or, if the changes
should be made by a program and not a person, the sqlite3 Ruby gem.

Let's interactively use the SQLite3 client to create some data:

```
~/sql-demo$ sqlite3 school.db
SQLite version 3.7.14.1 2012-10-04 19:37:12
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> .tables
departments  professors
sqlite> .schema departments
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255)
);
sqlite> INSERT INTO departments ("name") VALUES ("russian literature");
sqlite> SELECT * FROM departments;
1|mathematics
2|physics
3|russian literature
```

Notice that I didn't set the `departments.id` field; because this is
an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, SQLite3 will take care of populating it
[automatically for me][autoincrement].

[autoincrement]: http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q1

I can also add a new professor:

```
sqlite> INSERT INTO professors ("department_id", "first_name", "last_name") VALUES (3, "Vladimir", "Nabokov");
```

SQLite has a few special "meta" commands `.tables` and `.schema` which
list the existing tables and their schemas. Here I insert a new
department into the table, and then select it back out.

You can even run SQL commands from the command line:

```
~/sql-demo$ sqlite3 school.db "SELECT * FROM departments"
1|mathematics
2|physics
3|russian literature
```

## The SQLite gem

To interact with SQLite3 from your Ruby programs, use the gem
[sqlite3-ruby][sqlite-ruby-github]. I've written a
[demo][sqlite-ruby-demo] to show you how to use the gem. It is a very
simple, thin wrapper over SQL. You may need to install the sqlite3
gem:

    gem install sqlite3

Later we'll learn about a more object-oriented interface to SQL called
ActiveRecord. For now, I want you to get experience working directly
with SQL.

There's a good [FAQ][sqlite-ruby-faq] to check out.


## SQLite3 is not full featured

SQLite3 is not a full featured database. It is meant to be minimalist and
simple, but there are some features that would have been nice if it had:

* Older versions don't enforce foreign key constraints; they will
  ignore them.
    * Newer versions (newer than is default on OS X) enforce foreign key constraints.
* Dropping columns is a pain; you need to rebuild the whole table.
    * [How to drop columns][sqlite-add-drop] (hint: it's ugly).
* SQLite3 is overly permissive; it lets you assign, for instance, strings to
  non-varchar columns (it will apply an "implicit conversion").

For reasons like these, pretty much everyone running a web app will use a
more complete database in production (Postgres and MySQL are common choices).

None of these should bother you very much if you are using SQLite3 as a
development database which doesn't hold any mission-critical,
production data.

## Note to Ubuntu/Linux Users

Some students have had issues with the version of sqlite3 available from apt-get.
So you may want to download the sqlite3 binary from [sqlite.org][sqlite-download].
Be sure to click the "sqlite-shell-linux" link under **Precompiled Binaries for Linux**.
If you already installed SQLite via apt-get, run `sudo apt-get remove sqlite3`.

You can extract the binary executable to your `~/bin` directory (which you can create if
it doesn't already exist). Oftentimes, this will be in your PATH already. Test by
restarting your terminal and running `which sqlite3`. It should return something like
`/home/your_username/bin/sqlite3`. If it doesn't, you may need to add `~/bin` to your
path in your `~/.bashrc`.
