# Active Relation

## Queries are lazy

Querying methods like `group`, `having`, `includes`, `joins`, `select`
and `where` return an object of type `ActiveRecord::Relation`. The
`Relation` object looks a lot like an `Array`; like an `Array` you can
iterate through it or index into it.

There is one major difference from an `Array`: the contents of
`Relation` are not fetched until needed. This is called **laziness**:

```ruby
users = User.where("likes_dogs = ?", true) # no fetch yet!

# performs fetch here
users.each { |user| puts "Hello #{user.name}" }
# does not perform fetch; result is "cached"
users.each { |user| puts "Hello #{user.name}" }
```

The `Relation` is not evaluated (a database query is not fired) until
the results are needed. In this example, on the first line where
`users` is assigned, the result is not yet needed. Only when we call
`each` the first time do we actually need the results and the query is
forced.

### Caching

After the query is run, the results are **cached** by `Relation`; they
are stored for later re-use. Subsequent calls to `each` will not fire
a query; they will instead use the prior result. This is an advantage
because we can re-use the result without constantly hitting the
database over-and-over.

This can sometimes result in unexpected behavior. First, note that
when accessing a relation (e.g. `user1.posts`), a `Relation` object
is returned. The relation is itself cached inside model object (e.g.
`user1`) so that future invocations of the association will not hit
the DB.

```ruby
# Fires a query; `posts` relation stored in `user1`.
p user1.posts
# => []
p user1.posts.object_id
# => 70232180387400

Post.create!(
  :user_id => user1.id, # THIS LINE IS KEY, BECAUSE IT TIES THE POST TO THE USER IN THE DATABASE
  :title => "Title",
  :body => "Body body body"
)

# Does not fire a query; uses cached `posts` relation, which itself
# has cached the results.
p user1.posts
# => []
p user1.posts.object_id
# => 70232180387400
```

Here `user1.posts` fires a query the first time. The second time,
`user1.posts` uses the prior result. The cached result, however, is
out of date; in between the first time we called `user1.posts` and the
second time, we added a new `Post` for the user. This is not reflected
in the `user1.posts` variable.

This behavior can be surprising, but it actually is not a common
issue. You can always force an association to be reloaded (ignoring
any cached value) by calling `user1.posts(true)`. You may also call
`user1.reload` to throw away all cached association
relations. However, this is seldom necessary.

## Laziness and stacking queries

Caching results makes sense: it saves DB queries. But why is laziness
a good thing?

Laziness allows us to build complex queries. Let's see an example:

```ruby
georges = User.where("first_name = ?", "George")
georges.where_values
# => ["first_name = 'George'"]

george_harrisons = georges.where("last_name = ?", "Harrison")
george_harrisons.where_values
# => ["first_name = 'George'", "last_name = 'Harrison'"]

p george_harrisons
```

In this somewhat silly example, we call `where` twice. The first call
to `where` returns a `Relation` which knows to filter by `first_name`
(the condition is stored in the `where_values` attribute). Next, we
call `where` on this `Relation`; this produces a new `Relation` object
which will know to filter by both `first_name` and `last_name` (you
can see that `where_values` was extended`).

Note that the additional `where` created a new `Relation`; the
original `georges` is not changed.

The first `Relation` returned by the first `where` is never
evaluated. Instead, we build a second `Relation` from it. Here
laziness helps us; it lets us build up a query by chaining query
methods, none of which are executed until the chain is finished being
built and evaluated.

Just like `where` has a `where_values` attribute, there are similar
accessors for `includes_values`, `joins_values`, etc. You won't ever
access the attributes directly, but you can see how `Relation` builds
up the query by storing each of the conditions. When the `Relation`
needs to be evaluated, ActiveRecord looks at each of these values to
build the SQL to execute.

## Forcing evaluation

If you wish to force the evaluation of a `Relation`, you may call
`load`. This will force
evaluation if it hasn't been done already. Using `to_a` will return
an *actual* array.

Some other methods like `count` also force the evaluation of a query.
