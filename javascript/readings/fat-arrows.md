# Arrow Functions

Arrow functions, a.k.a. Fat Arrows, are a way of declaring functions. They were introduced in ES2015 as a way of solving many of the inconveniences of the normal callback function syntax. Consider the following example:

```javascript
// normal callback function
function showEach(array) {
  array.forEach(function(el) {
    console.log(el);
  });
}

// fat arrow function
function showEach(array) {
  array.forEach(el => console.log(el));
}
```

Both functions in the example above accomplish the same thing. However, the arrow syntax is shorter and easier to follow.  

## Anatomy of an Arrow Function
```js
(parameters, go, here) => {
  statements;
  return value;
}
```

For single-expression blocks, `{ }` and `return` are implied, and you may omit the `( )` when there is a single argument.
```javascript
argument => expression; // equal to (argument) => { return expression };
```

__N.B.:__ In JavaScript, an _expression_ is a line of code that returns a value. _Statements_ are, more generally, any line of code.

Arrow functions aren't just syntactic sugar for normal functions, though. They behave differently in some scenarios:

## Scope

Arrow functions, unlike normal functions, do not create a new scope. In other words, `this` means the same thing inside an arrow function that it does outside of it. Consider the following scenario with a normal function:

```javascript
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.toys = ['string', 'ball', 'balloon'];
};

Cat.prototype.play = function meow() {
  this.toys.forEach(function(toy) {
    console.log(`${this.name} plays with ${toy}`);
  });
};

let garfield = new Cat('garfield');
garfield.play();

// output
undefined plays with string
undefined plays with ball
undefined plays with balloon
```

`play` breaks because `this` in `this.name` refers to the scope of the `forEach` method. But if we rewrite `play` using a fat arrow function, it works:

```javascript
Cat.prototype.play = function meow() {
  this.toys.forEach(toy => console.log(`${this.name} plays with ${toy}`));
};

garfield.play();

//output
garfield plays with string
garfield plays with ball
garfield plays with balloon
```

## Implicit Returns

Fat arrows implicitly return when they consist of a single expression.
```javascript
let halfMyAge = myAge => myAge / 2;
halfMyAge(30) === 15; // true
```

This doesn't work if the fat arrow uses a block.
```javascript
let halfMyAge = myAge => {
  let age = myAge;
  age / 2;
}

typeof halfMyAge(30) === "undefined"; // true
```

To return a value from a fat arrow using a block, you must explicitly return.
```javascript
let halfMyAge = myAge => {
  let age = myAge;
  return age / 2;
}
halfMyAge(30) === 15; // true
```

## Potential Pitfalls

### Syntactic Ambiguity

```javascript
let ambiguousFunction = () => {}
```

In Javascript, `{}` can signify either an empty object or an empty block.

Is `ambiguousFunction` supposed to return an empty object? If so, it's broken because there's no way to distinguish between either. JS will default to an empty block.

```javascript
typeof ambiguousFunction() === "undefined"; // true
```

To make a single-expression fat arrow return an empty object, wrap it in parentheses:

```javascript
clearFunction = () => ({});
typeof clearFunction() === "object"; // true
```

### No Binding

Fat arrows don't scope like normal functions, so you can't reassign `this`, which is always what it was at the time the fat arrow was declared.
```javascript
let returnName = () => this.name;
returnName.call({name: 'Dale Cooper'}) // undefined;
```

### No Constructors

Fat arrows can't be used as constructors.

```javascript
const FatCat = (name) => this.name = name;

let g = new FatCat("garfield"); // TypeError: FatCat is not a constructor
```

### No `arguments`

Because they don't change scope, fat arrows don't have their own [`arguments`][arguments] object.

```javascript
const hasArgs = function() {
  let noArgs = () => arguments[0];
  return noArgs('FakeArg');
};

hasArgs('RealArg') // returns 'RealArg';
```

[arguments]: ./arguments.md

### No Names

Fat arrows are _anonymous_, like their [`lambda`][lambda] counterparts in other languages.  

```javascript
sayHello(name) => console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`); // SyntaxError
(name) => console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`); // correct
```

If you want to name your function you must assign it to a variable like this:
```js
const sayHello = (name) => console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
```
