# Tagged Template Literals

Putting a template literal directly after a function will trigger a function call.

```js

function yodaSays(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // ['',' loves ', '!']
  console.log(values); // ['Sarah', 'sushi']
  return `${values[1]}, ${values[0]} ${strings[1]}${strings[2]}`;
}

let name = 'Sarah', food = 'sushi';
let str = yodaSays `${name} loves ${food}!`;
console.log(str) // sushi, Sarah  loves !
```

The above code is probably pretty puzzling. `yodaSays` is going to be invoked on the line where we assign the `str` variable, because JavaScript will invoke a function if a template literal is directly after it.

The really interesting part is the arguments passed to `yodaSays`. Instead of passing the entire `Sarah loves sushi!` string as an argument, the string is split into substrings (split on the curly brace delimiters) and the substrings are passed as an array into the first argument of the function. Note that when an interpolated value starts or ends a template string, an empty string is added in front of or behind it.

 The interpolated values are passed as the remaining arguments, where we use the rest operator `...values` to capture them into a second array. We can then rearrange the string however we like using our `strings` and `values` arguments.

 A more real-world example might be using template literal taggings to rearrange the markup of an HTML string.
