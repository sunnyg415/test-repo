# JSX

## What is JSX?

[JSX][jsx] is a JavaScript syntax extension that resembles HTML and XML. React
code written in JSX mirrors the HTML it produces, improving readability and
ease-of-development.

Consider the following example in JSX and then in JS.

```js
// JSX
const quotes = (
	<div className='quotes'>
	  <h1>I love JavaScript!</h1>
	</div>
);
```

```js
// plain JavaScript
const quotes = React.createElement(
  'div',
  { className: 'quotes' },
  React.createElement(
    'h1',
    {},
    'I love Javascript'
  )
);
```

Both blocks of code ultimately produce the HTML:
```html
<div class='quotes'><h1>I love JavaScript!</h1></div>
```

and are rendered onto the `document.body` using:
```js
ReactDOM.render(quotes, document.body)
```

In both examples, the variable `quotes` is assigned to a React component that
renders the HTML onto the page when passed to `ReactDOM.render(quotes,
document.body)`. However, the example using JSX is much simpler and easier to
read.

## Interpolation

Even though it looks like HTML, JSX is still Javascript at the core. As such,
you can interpolate plain Javascript into JSX using `{}` between element tags or
for attribute values.

```js
let myClass = 'example';

const myElement = (
	<h1 className={myClass}>
		{1 + 2 + 3}
	</h1>
);		
```
`myElement` renders as
```html
<h1 class='example'>6<h1>
```

Note that, because the return value is inserted into your element, only
single expressions are allowed.

For example, this block of code throws a `SyntaxError`.
```js
const myElement = (
	<h1>
	{
		1 + 2 + 3;
		4 + 5 + 6;
	}
	</h1>
);
```

## Transpilation

JSX cannot be directly interpreted by browsers like Chrome or Firefox. Instead,
JSX code must be passed through a preprocessor, such as `Babel`, that
**transpiles** it into vanilla Javascript. You'll learn more about this in a
moment.

## Official Documentation

Although we'll only use JSX for developing React components, it can actually be
used in other applications as well. You can read more about JSX
