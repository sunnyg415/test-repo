# React Map Demo

This demo shows you how to integrate the Google Maps API into a React project, like we will be doing tomorrow when we build BenchBnB.  

Please read through the `index.html` and `map.jsx` files to see how map integration is achieved.  `map.jsx` has detailed comments explaining every line of code.  Understanding this demo is crucial to your success on tomorrow's project.
