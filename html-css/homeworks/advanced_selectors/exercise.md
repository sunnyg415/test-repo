## CSS Advanced Selectors Exercise

Using your latest HTML recipe page, update your most recent external stylesheet to practice styling more elements with advanced selectors.

1. Remove the css_reset.css link and make your own css_custom_reset.css.
2. Reset only the elements that you have on the page.
3. Set the `cursor:pointer` and `outline:none` properties for all radio buttons, select elements, and submit buttons.
4. Style the `background-color` of the submit button gold using the `last-child` selector and give it a darkening hover effect.
5. Color every other list element in the directions list with a light-grey background.
6. Use the `+` operator to select the first review preceding the Reviews header element and give it a 1px, solid, black, top border.
7. Style the radio buttons with stars! Use the `stars.png` file in the assets folder.

Compare your recipe page to [this example](./example.html) and [this stylesheet](../../assets/advanced_selectors.css). [Live version here](http://appacademy.github.io/curriculum/advanced_selectors.html).
