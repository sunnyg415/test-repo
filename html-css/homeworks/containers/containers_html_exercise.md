5. Add an aside element
6. Cut and paste all of the ingredients elements into the aside
7. Put the recipe image inside of a figure element
8. Add a figurecaption element below the figure
9. Cut the link to wikipedia from your description paragraph and paste it into the figcaption element
10. Add a section element to contain the figure, description and instruction elements
11. Add a footer element at the bottom
12. Add a paragraph element in the footer with some text/link about where the recipe originated from.
