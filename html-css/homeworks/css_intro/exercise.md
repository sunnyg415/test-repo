## CSS Workflow Exercise

Have some fun practicing with the Chrome Developer Tools!

1. Head over to [App Academy](http://appacademy.io)
2. Open up the Chrome Developer Tools, Elements and Styles Panes
3. Delete some HTML elements
4. Move around some HTML elements
5. Copy and paste some HTML elements
6. Edit some elements as HTML and change some text
7. Turn off some styles
8. Copy and paste some styles
9. Try to change some style property values
10. Take a screenshot of your most creative rendition of the App Academy homepage and send it to `instructors-sf@appacademy.io`

This exercise should stress the power of the developer tools and demonstrate how we can manipulate pages within the browser to make front-end development more efficient. Have fun exploring different CSS properties before we begin formally learning CSS syntax.
