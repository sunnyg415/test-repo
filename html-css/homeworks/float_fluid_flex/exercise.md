## CSS Fluid Grid & Flex Layouts Exercise

Use your latest html recipe page with the latest external stylesheet and update the stylesheet accordingly to practice styling more elements with floats and different layout techniques.

1. Instead of making the nav into an inline-block element, use float to put our nav in the top-right.
2. Just for fun, float the logo to the left and then clearfix the vertical collapse problem.
3. Replace the static px widths of our aside and main content section with a complete fluid custom_grid.css, note that this will require updating your html file with respective containers.
4. You may need to give your recipe image a width of 100% so it takes up the figure and does not have its natural static px width. Do this for all images by applying it to your cutom reset file.

Compare your results to [this example](./example.html), [this stylesheet](../../assets/float_fluid_flex.css) and [this grid stylesheet](../../assets/custom_grid.css). [Live version here](http://appacademy.github.io/curriculum/float_fluid_flex.html).
